title: Network Cable
---

All Raspberry Pi devices have wired network capabilities but only the Raspberry Pi 3, 3+, and 4 have built-in wireless connectivity. You can add WiFi capabilities to any Raspberry Pi models by plugging in [a USB WiFi dongle](https://amzn.to/2WncEMD). Either way, you need to setup your RPi wired to your router so you are going to need a network cable. I get all my cables from [monoprice](https://www.monoprice.com/).

Once that your Raspberry Pi is setup, you can remove the Network Cable and use the WiFi. I however always wire my Raspberry Pi to the router and switch off the WiFi. Either way will work fine.
