Of course you are going to need [a Raspberry Pi](https://amzn.to/35yrYdB) to get started. There are many different models available and this guide _should_ work on all models, although I have only tried it on the following models myself:

- [Raspberry Pi 4 4GB](https://amzn.to/35sv42J)
- [Raspberry Pi 3 B+ 1GB](https://amzn.to/3c3iAkw)

If you have another model, and successfully configured your RPi using this project, please let me know and I will add it to the list.
