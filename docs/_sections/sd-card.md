Next up, you need an SD Card which will functions as the hard drive of your RPi. The original Raspberry Pi Model A and Model B require full-size SD cards. The newer Raspberry Pi 1 Model A+, Model 1 B+, 2B, 3B, 3B+, 3A+, and 4B require microSD cards.

I've been using [Samsung's MicroSDXC EVO Select Memory Cards](https://amzn.to/35uKFi9) for my RPi projects.

The minimum-size SD card [recommended by raspberrypi.org](https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/faqs/#sd-cards) is 8GB. I've been using [128GB](https://amzn.to/2xu6dPt), [64GB](https://amzn.to/35uKFi9) and [32GB]() sizes. I've also had success with the [SanDisk Ultra 64GB microSDXC UHS-I Card](https://amzn.to/3fiUHaE).
